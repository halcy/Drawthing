Drawthing - A simple Swing sketch pad application.

To run: java Drawthing
To compile (Requires a JDK and some Make utility): make
(That, or figure out the command to build it without make)

Use the color button to select a color, brush size box to select
a brush size, draw on the white canvas with the mouse.

Resize the window to change canvas size. Minimum canvas size is
400x400. Canvas will automatically expand to bottom and right.

Undo and reset buttons do what you would expect them to do.

Save button allows you to save the current drawing to an SVG
file fit for further editing in a vector editor like inscape
or for display on the internet by newer browsers.

The newest version of this applications source code can be
